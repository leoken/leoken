## Installation

Clone the git repo - `git clone git://github.com/roots/roots.git` - or [download it](https://github.com/roots/roots/zipball/master) and then rename the directory to the name of your theme or website. [Install Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started), and then install the dependencies for Roots contained in `package.json` by running the following from the Roots theme directory:

```
npm install
```

Reference the [theme activation](http://roots.io/roots-101/#theme-activation) documentation to understand everything that happens once you activate Roots.

## Theme Development

After you've installed Grunt and ran `npm install` from the theme root, use `grunt watch` to watch for updates to your LESS and JS files and Grunt will automatically re-build as you write your code.

## Configuration

Edit `lib/config.php` to enable or disable support for various theme functions and to define constants that are used throughout the theme.

Edit `lib/init.php` to setup custom navigation menus and post thumbnail sizes.
